# Janggi

**Janggi** is an implementation of a Korean variant of chess by the same name, 
built in Python. My version includes a GUI (via PyGame) for a 
clickable interface. The interface includes some useful features such as 
move highlighting according to a piece's allowed move pattern and the state 
of other pieces on the board.
